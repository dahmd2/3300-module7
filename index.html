        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          According to PEW Research, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review
          scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game
          and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales
          data obtained from VGChartz.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="data">
        <h2>2. Data</h2>
        <p>
          This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic’s game
          critic and game player review scores of different games and VGChartz
          data about video game sales.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game. Metacritic’s data
          was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to
          collect all data across these 186 pages. I collected the game title,
          summary, platform, user score, meta score, and release date for 18,526
          games. Some of the results were the same game that was released on
          different platforms, which is essential to consider when I begin
          merging the data. I created a data frame which is contained in the
          Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web crawling script
          that I wrote is contained in the metacritic.R file in the project
          folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data didn’t need much cleaning; however, to make the platform
          match with the VGChartz data, I created a dictionary to convert
          Metacritic’s platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done
          in the file combining_vgs.R.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and
          navigate the relationship between the different types of sales and
          review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to
          explore the relationship between variables. There was a correlation
          coefficient of .954 between the total sales and North American sales.
          This is evidence of an extremely strong correlation between these two
          variables. North American sales make up 48.7% of the total sales,
          which is a significant reason for this strong correlation. However,
          the correlation between sales and review scores was very weak. The
          correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score was .248,
          and it was .102 between total sales and user score. While there was a
          moderate correlation between user score and meta score at .524, it is
          nowhere near as strong as it was between the two sales variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first thought this weaker correlation might be due to the difference
          in rating scales between the two groups of people. To prove this was
          not the case, I created a boxplot of the two scores, using ggplot4.
          This plot is shown in Figure 1. While there might be slight
          differences in the interquartile range, the medians of the two
          variables are the same. However, taking the difference between their
          means results in a value of 1.67, which is somewhat significant. A
          histogram that compares the two variables, such as the one in Figure
          2, gives us a good insight into the reason behind the difference in
          means. We can see that the meta scores have much higher counts of high
          reviews, while the user score has a greater number of low reviews.
          This may be part of the reason why the meta score has a slightly
          better correlation with sales than the user score.

          />
          <figcaption>Figure 2 Review Score Histograms.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The meta score is a better predictor of sales than the user score.
          While the correlation isn’t very strong, it does exist. There is some
          basis for the reason behind this correlation. Many companies send out
          review copies to critics in hopes that the reviews will boost sales5.
          Critics usually publish their review scores in the days before a game
          is released. This increases excitement around the game before the
          general release date benefitting both the video game company and the
          critic.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the correlation appears to show that there probably isn’t as
          much benefit in this manufacturer critic relationship as the
          manufacturer would like. I initially thought the weak correlation
          might be due to the large number of games with little sales. I
          recalculated the correlation coefficient between meta score and total
          sales which produced even less of a correlation at .065. While high
          review scores may help a company’s reputation, they do not correlate
          well with more sales.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
        <p>
          To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame, publisher_df, which was grouped by the
          publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
          sales’ sum, and the number of games each publisher has released. To
          find the publishers with the highest sales, I took a slice_max of the
          data frame based on the total sales. The result appears in Table 2.
          The information is also saved in the publisher_sales.csv file in the
          project folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I noticed that all but one publisher released at least 800 games. I
          calculated the correlation between the total sales and the number of
          games a publisher had released. The coefficient of correlation between
          these two variables was .715, which demonstrates a strong correlation
          between the number of games released and the total sales of a
          publisher. Because of this strong correlation, I thought creating a
          scatterplot between the two variables would be useful to analyze the
          data further. The scatterplot can be seen in Figure 3 below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./images/3-total_sales_number_games_released.jpg"
            alt="Scatterplot of number of games and total sales"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 3 Scatterplot of Games Released vs. Total Sales.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This correlation does not apply to the number of games released and
          the publisher’s average meta score. The correlation coefficient
          between these two variables is -.013, which is evidence of no
          relationship between the number of games released and the average meta
          score.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the strong correlation between the number of games and total
          sales, we can predict that a company’s average meta score doesn’t
          significantly impact its total sales. When we compare the average meta
          score of 71.145 to the values in Table 2 (above), we prove that meta
          scores and sales aren’t strongly correlated, as 30% of the
          observations in Table 2 are below the average. This can also be seen
          in Figure 4, a scatterplot of the number of games released and the
          meta score. Figure 4 Scatterplot of the number of games by a publisher
          and meta score

        <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
        <p>
          To determine how sales, number of games released, and review scores
          have changed, I created a data frame called by_month, which grouped
          the games by month and calculated the average review scores, the sum
          of sales, and the number of games. The correlation coefficient between
          the release date and the number of games released is .533, which is
          evidence of some correlation, but it is not especially strong.

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I analyzed three aspects of video game sales: the
          publisher, the release date, and how a game’s sales and review scores
          influence each other. In summary, from the analysis questions
          presented in my proposal, I found the following results.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is limited correlation between review scores and sales. But
          while the correlation isn’t very strong, it does appear meta score is
          a better predictor of sales than the user score.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some correlation between release date and the number of games
          released, but it is not especially strong. There was a peak in the
          number of games released around 2010 but since there has been a
          decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same ten publishers are present in both total sales and North
          American sales, just in a different order. Nintendo is solidly in
          first place with 1.9 billion games sold followed by Activision at
          number two with 727 million units sold.
